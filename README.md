# Moode OS Builder

The Moode OS Builder written by @Koda59 automates the process of creating the custom Linux OS that runs moOde audio player. The Builder requires a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian with SSH enabled and at least 2.5 GB free space on the boot SDCard. The build can be written directly to the boot SDCard or to a second USB-SDCard plugged into the Raspberry Pi.
