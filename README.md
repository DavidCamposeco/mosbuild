Moode OS Builder
== 
The Moode OS Builder automates the process of creating the custom Linux OS that runs moOde audio player. The Builder requires a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian with SSH enabled and at least 2.5 GB free space on the boot SDCard. The build can be written directly to the boot SDCard (direct build) or to a second USB-SDCard plugged into the Raspberry Pi. If a direct build is performed then the Pi must be running Raspbian Stretch Lite.
