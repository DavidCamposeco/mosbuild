# Moode OS Builder

The Moode OS Builder automates the process of creating the custom Linux OS that runs moOde audio player. The Builder requires a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian with SSH enabled, at least 2.5 GB free space on the boot SDCard, and an Internect connection, preferably via Ethernet. The build can be written directly to the boot SDCard (direct build) or to a second USB-SDCard plugged into the Raspberry Pi. If a direct build is performed then the Pi must be running Raspbian Stretch Lite.

# Moode OS Builder

The Moode OS Builder is a script that runs on a Raspberry Pi and automates the process of creating the custom Linux OS that runs moOde audio player. The Builder requires a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian with SSH enabled, at least 2.5 GB free space on the boot SDCard, and an Internect connection, preferably via Ethernet

The OS can be built directly on the boot SDCard (direct build) or on a second USB-SDCard plugged into the Raspberry Pi. If the direct build method is used then the Pi must be running the exact release of Raspbian Stretch Lite specified in the Build requirements. The USB-SDCard method automatically uses the correct release of Raspbian Stretch Lite.

A typical Build takes around 1 hour and during that time the Pi will automatically reboot many times as the build progresses through each of its sections. 

## Monitoring the Build

A log file is maintained during the Build and can be monitored via SSH using the commands below. If errors appear in the log then simply reboot and the Builder will resume starting at the beginning of the section where the error occured. Errors are typically caused by busy Source code repositories that refuse connections.

- mosbrief	Prints only the Build log section headers
- moslog	Prints each line of the Build log in real-time
- moslast	Prints only the last few lines of the Build log

## Verifying a successful Build

The Build is successful when the last line of the Build log is:

// END

# Build requirements

If using the direct build method then boot a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Stretch Lite release 2017-11-29. No other release is guaranteed to work. If using a second USB-SDCard for the Build then make sure its not plugged into the Pi prior to starting the Build.

## Download the Builder script

Connect to the Pi via SSH and then run the commands listed below.

cd /home/pi<br>
sudo wget -q http://moodeaudio.org/downloads/mos/mosbuild.sh -O /home/pi/mosbuild.sh<br>
sudo chmod +x /home/pi/mosbuild.sh

## Start the Builder

sudo ./mosbuild.sh

Follow the instructions and prompts that will appear. The Build runs in two stages. The first stage prepares the SDCard with the files and configuration necessary for the second stage which is where the majority of the OS Build process takes place.

## After the first stage of the Build conpletes

When the first stage of the Build has completed one of two completion banners will be printed depending on which build method was choosen in the beginning. Follow the instructions in the completion banner to start the second stage of the Build.

### USB-SDCard method

** Base OS image created on second USB SDCard drive

Remove the USB SDCard drive and use the SDCard to boot a Pi.\
The build will automatically continue at STEP 2 after boot.\
It can take around 1 hour to complete.\

Use cmds: mosbrief, moslog and moslast to monitor the process.

** Save base OS img for additional builds (y/n)? 

### Direct build method

** Base OS image created on boot SDCard

Pi must be powered off then back on.\
The build will automatically continue at STEP 2 after power on.\
It can take around 1 hour to complete.\

Use cmds: mosbrief, moslog and moslast to monitor the process.

** Power off the Pi (y/n)? 

## During the second stage of the Build

Periodivcally monitor the build process for an error block in the build log that indicates the Build has exited (stopped) and can be resumed. In this case simply reboot the pi and the Build will resume at the beginning of the section that contained the error. 

** Error: image build exited
** Error: reboot to resume the build

Sometimes when the source code reposiories are busy they will refuse connections. This is the most common cause of errors in the build process. The build may have to be resumed multiple times.
